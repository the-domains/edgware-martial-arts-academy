Choi Kwang-Do (CKD) is a revolutionary Martial Art designed scientifically and developed to promote Good Health & Fitness, Personal Development and Practical Self Defence.

Main Areas of Focus:

**Optimum Health**

The techniques are designed to work in harmony with the human body, eliminating unnecessary stress and hyper-extension.  
CKD training provides many opportunities to enhance your physical and mental strength, flexibility, agility and co-ordination.

Maintenance of Health should be important to everyone.

**Practical Self Defence**

Avoidance and awareness are paramount. However, in the worst-case scenario that you have to use your defensive skills, the fluid and powerful striking techniques can enable you to stun, stop and finish an attacker. Size is not an issue.

**Personal Development**

An important focus within our training is personal, social and professional development. The benefits are achievable through positive attributes such as discipline, self-confidence and respect.

**Cross Lateral and Bi-Lateral Movement Development**

As well as training towards the above, CKD also trains on the basic motor skills within the human body. The repetitious movements and syllabus lends toward improving the health of the Mind and the Body by using the whole of the brain, all muscle groups and fast twitch muscle fibre that help to repair damaged brain cells and expand muscle memory.

This system continues to evolve while maintaining an equal focus on health, self defence, personal development and helping the body to continue working in harmony with itself.

_'Do'_literally translates as_'The Art Of'_and so Choi Kwang Do translates as**'The Art of Kwang Choi'.**
