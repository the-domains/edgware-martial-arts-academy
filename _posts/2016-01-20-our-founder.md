Grandmaster Kwang Jo Choi  
President and Founder of  
Choi Kwang-Do Martial Art International

Kwang Jo Choi, 9th Degree Black Belt Grandmaster, was born on March 2, 1942, in Tae Gu City, Korea, which was under Japanese control at the time. He started training in the Martial Arts at the age of 12 because his father was concerned as Kwang Jo was small and physically weak, and he wanted his son to be able to protect himself in the war-torn streets. Kwang Jo's first official Martial Arts Instructors were Grandmaster Dong Ju Lee and Grandmaster Jung D Cho. They trained him in Kwon Bup, a form of Korean karate.  
During his military service, Kwang Jo became a Chief Instructor in the 20th Infantry Division and came into contact with General Choi Hong Hi (the founder of Tae Kwon-Do) when the military began to use that system for unarmed combat.  
After completing his military service, Kwang Jo traveled to Seoul to see General Choi, who taught him the art. Shortly thereafter, Kwang Jo was named a Chief Instructor for the International Tae Kwon-Do Federation (ITF) and taught Martial Arts Instructors from all over Korea and overseas. At the same time, Kwang Jo served as an Instructor for the national police department, and taught many military Instructors and members of the armed forces. In 1967, the ITF sanctioned him as one of six Instructors to demonstrate and promote Tae Kwon-Do throughout Southeast Asia.  
Due to the lockout movements of his traditional Martial Arts training, Kwang Jo injured his body, which forced him to move to North America for medical treatment in 1970\. After visits with many doctors, Kwang Jo decided to rehabilitate his body without surgery.  
He also studied physical therapy techniques and slowly began to recuperate and heal his condition. It was during this process that Kwang Jo started realizing that the harsher; lockout movements used in conventional Martial Arts had caused his injuries. As a result, he began to study anatomy, physiology and human-movement sciences.  
Armed with this new knowledge, GMC began teaching a modified form of Tae Kwon-Do utilising the principles of efficient human movement although at this time he called it_'Tae Kwon Do Kwan Duk Kwang'._From 1978 -- 1987 GMC continued developing the techniques and formulating a training system that he believed would be both effective and beneficial for the health of the practitioner: Choi Kwang-Do was born.
